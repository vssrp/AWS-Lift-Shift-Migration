# AWS Lift & Shift Migration

## Overview
This project details the **Lift & Shift** strategy for migrating a **Multi-Tier Web Application Stack** to AWS cloud for production. The **Lift & Shift** approach involves moving workloads to AWS **without significant architectural modifications**, ensuring minimal downtime and quick cloud adoption.

## Challenges Addressed
- **Complex Infrastructure Management:** Managing on-premise workloads is difficult.
- **Scaling Complexity:** Scaling applications up or down manually is time-consuming.
- **High Costs:** Significant **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)** and **OpEx (Operational Expenditure)** expenses.
- **Manual Processes:** Lack of automation results in inefficiencies.

## AWS-Based Solution
- **Automation:** Infrastructure provisioning and scaling automation.
- **Cloud Setup:** Pay-as-you-go pricing model to reduce upfront costs.
- **Ease of Management:** Reduced maintenance overhead.
- **Scalability:** Dynamic resource scaling.

## AWS Services Utilized
- **Amazon EC2 Instances:** Compute resources for application workloads.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):** Distributes traffic efficiently.
- **Auto Scaling:** Dynamically adjusts compute resources.
- **Amazon RDS (MySQL):** Managed relational database service.
- **Memcached:** In-memory caching for performance improvements.
- **Amazon S3 & EFS:** Object and file storage solutions.
- **Route 53:** DNS service for private domain name resolution.
- **RabbitMQ:** Message broker for application communication.
- **Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM):** SSL/TLS certificate management.

## Architecture Overview
- **EC2 instances** host various application components.
- **ELB ensures high availability** by distributing requests across multiple instances.
- **Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts** the number of running instances.
- **EFS & S3 provide shared storage** for application data.
- **Route 53 manages DNS resolution** for the application.
- **Memcached and RabbitMQ** optimize application performance.
- **Security groups** control network access.

## Benefits of Lift & Shift
- **Minimal Changes:** No significant code modifications required.
- **Rapid Cloud Adoption:** Faster migration to AWS.
- **Cost Optimization:** Reduced upfront costs with flexible pricing.
- **Improved Scalability:** Resources scale based on demand.
- **High Availability:** ELB and Auto Scaling ensure reliability.
