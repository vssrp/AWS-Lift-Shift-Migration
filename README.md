## Features
- Migration of workloads from on-premises to AWS.
- Infrastructure provisioning using AWS services.
- Security, compliance, and best practices for cloud migration.
- Performance optimization post-migration.
- Monitoring and cost management strategies.

## Prerequisites
### Requirements
- AWS account with necessary permissions.
- Network and security requirements assessed.
- IAM roles and policies configured.
- Source environment access for migration.
- Backup strategy in place.

## Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Assess and Plan
